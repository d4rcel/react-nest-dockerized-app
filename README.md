# [PoC] Dockerized Full-Stack Application

This repository contains a proof of concept (PoC) for a full-stack application that is fully dockerized. It consists of a Next.js client, a Nest.js server, an audit microservice (Nest.js), PostgreSQL as the database, and NATS streaming for messaging. The project demonstrates how these components can interact within a containerized environment using Docker Compose.

## Overview

This project is a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** for demonstrating how to dockerize and orchestrate a full-stack application with different components, including:

- **Next.js (Client)**: The frontend application built with React.
- **Nest.js (Server)**: The backend REST API that handles authentication and interacts with the database.
- **Audit Microservice**: A microservice built with Nest.js that listens for login events and logs them into the database using NATS streaming.
- **PostgreSQL (Database)**: The relational database where user data and audit logs are stored.
- **NATS (Messaging System)**: A messaging system that facilitates communication between the server and the audit microservice.

## Technologies

- **Next.js (React)** - Client-side application.
- **Nest.js** - Backend REST API and microservices.
- **PostgreSQL** - Database to persist data.
- **NATS Streaming** - Message broker for event-driven architecture.
- **Docker** - Containerization.
- **Docker Compose** - Orchestrates multiple containers.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (v20+ recommended)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (v2+ recommended)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

You need to configure environment variables in a `.env` file. Below is an example of the variables needed:

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project with the following content:

```bash
# DB
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=myuser
DB_PASS=mypassword
DB_NAME=mydb

# Backend
BACKEND_PORT=3001
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Frontend
FRONTEND_PORT=3000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Auth
JWT_SECRET=my_secret_key
SALT_ROUNDS=10

# NATS
NATS_CLUSTER_ID=my-cluster
NATS_URL=nats://localhost:4222
NATS_PORT=4222
```

Make sure to adjust any credentials or configuration as needed.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tiesch/fullstack-dockerized-app.git
    cd fullstack-dockerized-app
    ```

2. Ensure Docker is running:
   Make sure Docker Desktop (or your Docker engine) is up and running.

3. Build and run the Docker containers:
   You can start all the services by running the following command:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
   This will build the images for all the services and start the containers. The --build flag ensures that the images are rebuilt if any changes have been made to the Dockerfiles.

4. Access the applications:
- Client (Next.js): Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000
- Server (Nest.js): The backend API will be running at http://localhost:3001
- NATS: The NATS server is available on port 4222 for message handling.
- Audit Service: The audit service runs in the background and listens for NATS events.
- PostgreSQL Database: PostgreSQL is running on port 5432.


## Seed data

To add a sample user to the database, you have two options: running a seed script directly from the server or using a curl command to register a user via the API.

### Option 1: Using the seed script

You can seed the database by running the following command, which will create a default user in the database.

1. Make sure the server is running.
2. Navigate to the /server directory.
3. Run the following command:
    ```bash
    pnpm run seed
    ```
    This will execute a script to seed the database with initial data. (email=admin@local, password=1234)

### Option 2: Using CURL

Alternatively, you can manually register a user via the API by sending a POST request using curl.

1. Make sure the server is running on localhost:3001.
2. Execute the following curl command to create a user with the name John:
    ```bash
    curl --location 'localhost:3001/auth/register' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "johndoe@gmail.com",
        "password": "1234",
        "role": "admin"
    }'
    ```
    This command will create a user with the role of “admin” in the database.

## Available Services

- Client (Next.js): The frontend that interacts with the backend to authenticate users and perform actions.

  URL: http://localhost:3000

- Server (Nest.js): The backend API that manages user authentication and interaction with the database.

  URL: http://localhost:3001

- Audit Microservice: The microservice that logs login events by subscribing to the NATS server.

- PostgreSQL Database: The relational database where data is persisted.

- NATS Streaming: The messaging broker that facilitates communication between the backend and the microservices.

## Testing and Development

To make changes to the project for development:

1. Edit the code in the client, server, or audit-service directories.

2. Use docker-compose down to stop the containers and docker-compose up --build to rebuild the images and start them again.

3. Logs for each service can be viewed using:
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f [service-name]
    ```
   Replace [service-name] with client, server, audit-service, nats-server, or db to view logs for a specific service.


## Troubleshooting

- Database loses data after restart: Ensure that Docker volumes are configured correctly for PostgreSQL persistence.

- Connection issues between services: Make sure services are using the correct names as defined in the docker-compose.yml. Ensure that all services are on the same network.

- CORS errors: Check that the CORS_ORIGIN variable is correctly set in the .env file and that the client URL is properly configured in the backend.
